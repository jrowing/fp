  I have two separate git repos, each of which includes its own copy of the identical
  eruby_util.rb script. I want to make sure that these stay consistent.
  If I edit the master, so it's newer than the copies, this script automatically updates 
  the copies; this shouldn't cause data loss, since any overwritten version was presumably
  committed to its own project's git repo. If a copy differs from the master and is newer,
  it's an error. The script 101_reconcile_eruby_util.pl should not be in the git
  repos, because it's only useful to me.
